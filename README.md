# latexcv - LaTex CV and Resume Example

## Summary

This is based on the LaTex Resumes at https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv. Before
you start here it's worth reading those.

The resumes here are different from https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv in the
following ways:

* Only the classing and Infographics are present
* There are online and print versions. The print versions have minor structure
modifications to accomodate paper (e.g., no blue background on the infographic)
* There is a classic two page example along with the one page. It's meant to be
printed front and back
* On the classic two page resume there accomodations for publication and presentation
areas

Want to give a shout out to @jankapunkt for a great template.


## How to build?

You can build them from this source. In each folder is a main.tex, which needs to be compiled by your LaTex distribution. The main.pdf shows the example output.

There are just few requirements:

- package tex-live distribution
- package tex-live fonts
- (in miktex all requirements should be included at compile-time)
- run the main.tex and build with a (pdf-) LaTeX environment of your choice
